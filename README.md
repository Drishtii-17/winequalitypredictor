Project Overview
Wine quality prediction is critical in the wine industry, where quality assessment is subjective and requires expertise. This project predicts wine quality using machine learning models, based on features such as acidity, sugar levels, pH, and alcohol content. The goal is to classify wines as high-quality (score ‚â• 7) or low-quality (score < 7) based on physicochemical data.

Dataset Information
The dataset used is the Wine Quality Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains information on red wine samples with the following details:

Number of samples: 1,599
Number of features: 12
Features:
Fixed Acidity
Volatile Acidity
Citric Acid
Residual Sugar
Chlorides
Free Sulfur Dioxide
Total Sulfur Dioxide
Density
pH
Sulphates
Alcohol
Quality (target variable)
Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values.
Renaming columns for better readability.
Encoding categorical variables using pd.get_dummies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing feature distributions using histograms.
Examining correlations using a heatmap.
Bar plots to analyze the relationship between quality and features (e.g., alcohol content).
Feature Engineering:

Creating a binary target variable (best quality).
Removing highly correlated features.
Standardizing and normalizing features for better model performance.
Model Building:

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Training models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluating accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.
Confusion matrices to understand model predictions.
Algorithms Used
The following algorithms were implemented and compared:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
XGBoost Classifier
Each algorithm was optimized for accuracy and evaluated using cross-validation.
